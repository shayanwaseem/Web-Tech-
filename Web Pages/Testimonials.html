			God is Awesome!! Every year I look forward to the 4th weekend in May with great anticipation. Our WIEN-CCF Ladies Retreat continues to grow and the anointing gets richer and richer every year. Don't miss 2013! Lots of surprises and a great time in the presence of God with the best sisters this side of Heaven awaits you!

			The first CCF retreat I attended was in 2011. In the very first session, God spoke to my heart through Sis.Sharon Harris and that day I had a breakthrough. God broke my 12 year battle with depression in an instant. I have never looked back since. This is a retreat to expect breakthrough and miracles because and only because Jesus always shows up. The presence of our mighy God is so powerful amidst these anointed women of God who choose to take time to get away from their daily lives and come to honour our Saviour and King. I have been so blessed over the years by the retreat and have found my sisters-in-spirit here. I know that God is going to do amazing things in the years to come.
			I am so excited and  looking forward to this years retreat.
